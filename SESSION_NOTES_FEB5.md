## 🧪 To Test Tomorrow

1. **Start server**:
   ```bash
   cd ~/stemscribe && python3 backend/app.py
   ```

2. **Test vocal split**: Load any song in practice mode, click 🎤 on vocals

3. **Test tab links**: Should see Songsterr/UG buttons in header

4. **Run guitar training** (when you have time):
   ```bash
   cd ~/stemscribe/train_guitar_model
   ./RUN_ME.sh
   ```
